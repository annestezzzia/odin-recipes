            <h3 class="titles">Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Egg Yolks: Egg yolks are essential for a thick, rich,
                    velvety
                    smooth filling. Though some traditional recipes use raw
                    eggs,
                    this one doesn't — raw eggs carry the risk of food-borne
                    illness.</li>
                <li>Sugar: White sugar is cooked with egg yolks and combined
                    with
                    mascarpone to create a sweet, creamy filling.</li>
                <li>Milk: Whole milk slightly thins the thick filling, resulting
                    in
                    a spreadable texture.</li>
                <li>Cream: Beat heavy cream until stiff peaks form to create an
                    irresistible whipped cream.</li>
                <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract adds subtle flavor to the homemade
                    whipped cream.</li>
                <li>Mascarpone: Mascarpone, a creamy Italian cheese with a
                    smooth
                    texture and fresh taste, is a key ingredient in classic
                    tiramisu.</li>
                <li>Coffee: Ladyfingers are soaked in strong, spiked coffee —
                    this
                    is what gives tiramisu its signature flavor.</li>
                <li>Rum: Rum is used to spike the coffee that will be drizzled
                    over
                    the ladyfingers. Some Allrecipes community members say they
                    prefer Kahlua.</li>
                <li>Ladyfingers: Ladyfingers are small sponge cakes that are
                    shaped
                    like thick fingers. If you can't find ladyfingers at your
                    grocery store, you can use pound cake cut into strips.</li>
                <li>Cocoa Powder: Finish off this decadent dessert with a
                    generous
                    dusting of cocoa powder.</li>

            <h3 class="titles">Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk egg yolks and sugar together in a medium saucepan
                    until
                    well blended.</li>
                <li>Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring
                    constantly,
                    until mixture comes to a boil.</li>
                <li>Boil gently for 1 minute, then remove from the heat and
                    allow to
                    cool slightly.</li>
                <li>Cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Beat cream and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric
                    mixer
                    until stiff peaks form.</li>
                <li>Remove egg yolk mixture from the refrigerator; add
                    mascarpone
                    cheese and whisk until smooth.</li>
                <li>Combine coffee and rum in a small bowl. Split ladyfingers in
                    half lengthwise and drizzle with the coffee mixture. Arrange
                    1/2
                    of the soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 7x11-inch
                    dish.</li>
                <li>Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers,
                    then
                    spread 1/2 of the whipped cream over top. Repeat layers once
                    more.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle cocoa powder over top. Cover and refrigerate until
                    set,
                    4 to 6 hours.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
