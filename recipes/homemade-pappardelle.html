        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p1>With a few kitchen accessories you can make homemade
            pappardelle, a broad pasta noodle which welcomes a variety of
            different sauces. I chose to make a pesto cream sauce.</p1>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup 00 flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>1/4 cup semolina flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 00 flour, semolina flour, and eggs in the bowl of a food
                processor. Pulse until dough comes together.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured cutting board, knead dough about 10 times
                with the palm of your hand. Cover dough with a damp towel, and
                rest for about 10 minutes. Shape dough into a disc. Wrap dough
                and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place dough on a lightly floured surface and dust with flour.
                Using a rolling pin, and starting in the middle of the dough,
                push away from you. Roll dough into a sheet, then tri-fold it
                like a letter: pick up one end of dough, fold it over 1/3 of the
                way, then bring the opposite end over 1/3 of the way. Continue
                rolling out dough until it is thin. Let rest 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Loosely roll dough like a cinnamon roll. Using a sharp knife,
                cut into 3/4-inch-wide slices. Unwrap noodles; dust with
                semolina, and gently toss to separate.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, and cook noodles,
                until tender with a bite, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
