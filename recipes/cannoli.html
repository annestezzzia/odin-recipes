            <h3>Description</h3>

            <p1>This cannoli recipe was invented on July
                31st, 2005. I spent a
                lot
                of
                time looking for a good recipe for cannoli shells and filling.
                Since
                no
                two were alike, and since instructions were a bit sketchy, I
                worked
                with
                a friend, Ana, to come up with a good recipe, including some
                tips
                that
                we came up with along the way. Special equipment is needed such
                as
                cannoli tubes, a pasta machine, and a pastry bag to help make
                these
                cannoli come out just like the ones at Italian restaurants and
                bakeries.
                Start with 1/2 cup of confectioners' sugar, and then add more.

                <p2>You might be intimidated by the idea of
                    making cannolis at
                    home, but you shouldn’t be! This cannoli recipe proves
                    anyone can make
                    the iconic Italian treat.</p2> </div>

                <h3 class="titles">Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make the cannoli dough. Cover with storage wrap and
                        chill
                        for at
                        least an hour.</li>
                    <li>Divide the dough into three balls and flatten each one.
                    </li>
                    <li>Roll each ball through the pasta machine until it has
                        reached
                        the thinnest setting.</li>
                    <li>Use a cutter to cut the dough into circles. Dust with
                        flour
                        and
                        roll around cannoli tubes. </li>
                    <li>Seal with egg white and fry the tubes in hot oil. Remove
                        the
                        tubes. </li>
                    <li>Make the filling and pipe it into the cooled shells.
                        Dust
                        with
                        sugar to serve.</li>
                </ol>
